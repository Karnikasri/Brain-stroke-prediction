Brain Stroke Detection Web Application
This project is a web-based application designed for detecting brain strokes using machine learning techniques. The application is developed using a combination of Python, JavaScript, HTML, and leverages frameworks such as Flask and Django to create an efficient and user-friendly interface for real-time stroke prediction.

Key Technologies Used:

<>Python: For implementing the machine learning models and back-end logic.
<>Flask/Django: Frameworks used for building the web server and managing the back-end.
<>JavaScript/HTML: To create an interactive and responsive front-end for users.
